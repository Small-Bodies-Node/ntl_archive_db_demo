PDS-SBN Archive Data Base Demo
==============================

The Planetary Data System (PDS) Small Bodies Node (SBN) Archive Data Base Demo presented here integrates
observations of comets from the SBN data archives into a single data base with an API designed to accommodate
application development. The database, API development, and prototype search below were all designed and
coded as part of a series of challenges posed by the NASA Tournament Lab. The search and API was developed as
a rapid prototype, and gives just a small taste of the possibilities open to developers interested in using
PDS data in apps for scientists, amateurs, teachers, and the general public.

Documentation for various aspects of this code is available in the respective docs directories.
