PDS-SBN Archive Data Base Demo
==============================

The Planetary Data System (PDS) Small Bodies Node (SBN) Archive Data Base Demo online interface presented here 
integrates accommodate application development. The database, API development, and prototype search below were 
all designed and coded as part of a series of challenges posed by the NASA Tournament Lab. The search and API 
was developed as a rapid prototype, and gives just a small taste of the possibilities open to developers 
interested in using PDS data in apps for scientists, amateurs, teachers, and the general public.

Outline of directories:

|  front_end - Online web interface for searching the demo archive database.
|  import_and_persistence - Tools for loading the backend database from PDS3 data.
|  web_service - API for accessing the demo archive database.
|  web_service_javascript - Demo usage of the web_service API.

Documentation for various aspects of this code is available in the respective docs directories.
